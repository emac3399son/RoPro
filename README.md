RoPro Launcher is a third-party replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper, providing additional useful features and improvements.

RoPro Launcher is only supported for PCs running Windows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. Just be sure you're downloading it from an official source. The only two official sources are this GitHub repository and Our Discord Server.

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No, it shouldn't. RoPro Launcher doesn't interact with the Roblox client in the same way that exploits do. Although using visual Fast Flags that other users will see may report you and we do **NOT** take any responsability.
## Features

- Hassle-free Discord Rich Presence to let your friends know what you're playing at a glance
- Simple support for modding of content files for customizability (death sound, mouse cursor, etc)
- See where your server is geographically located (courtesy of [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io))

## Installing
Download the latest release of RoPro Launcher in our Discord server **currently only**.

You will also need the [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install RoPro after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run RoPro for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, RoPro is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.

## Code

RoPro Launcher currently uses WinForms .NET Framework 4.8 by Microsoft Corporation.
